			<h1>Floatworks case study</h1>
			<em class="intro">I was asked by Floatworks to comprehensively redesign their website (which I had designed in 2005). I was the sole designer and developer on the project, working closely with the client to create a site which the company and their community of customers would be proud of.</em>

			<h3>About the client</h3>
			<p>Floatworks is a retail service business in London. They opened their first shop in 1993 and now are the largest floatation centre in the world. They offer hour-long floatation sessions and many other complementary therapies to a diverse customer base.</p>
			<p>The client's objectives were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increase revenue from online sales</li>
				<li>Reduce time spent by reception staff handling customer queries</li>
				<li>Promote their new products and services</li>
				<li>Articulate their brand messaging clearly and elegantly</li>
				<li>Encourage repeat visits</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Refreshing the brand</h2>
			<p>The roundel and glossy "web 2.0" style of the old logo was at odds with the personality of the brand. I chose to retain the iconic floating man character, but losing any frame-like surrounding elements, which is far more congruent with the idea of floatation as a liberating experience.   </p>
			<p>The logotype was revitalised with simple typography. The typeface (Candara) is unfussy and clear, yet also looks playful as there are no straight lines in the letterforms.</p>

			<h2>Information architecture</h2>
			<p>The content from the old site had to be audited to determine which areas were deficient. I then defined user-centered objectives for the new site and reorganised the content in a way that supported them. </p>
			<p>These objectives were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Present key information early in the user journey (as visitors only saw 3.06 pages on average)</li>
				<li>Make booking and ordering possible within 2 minutes</li>				
				<li>Promote the Floatworks community, through Facebook and Twitter</li>
				<li>Preempt questions and obstacles by making helpful information and unintrusive customer support part of the user journey</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Testing the assumptions made in that first version of the architecture was critical, so I used my preferred <strong>rapid prototyping</strong> tool, Adobe Fireworks.</p>

			<h2>Photoshoot</h2>
			<p>One aspect of the outgoing site that was lacking was the imagery - there were only a handful of images provided by manufacturers which sat uneasily with Floatworks' positioning. This was partly because the client had never in their 18 years of trading set up a floatation tank in a photo studio. (Not too suprising considering the star of the show has to be transported by truck and takes a full day to assemble.)</p>
			<p>I organised the shoot, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Casting the models</li>			
				<li>Hiring the photographer, videographer and makeup artist</li>			
				<li>Managing a crew of 6</li>
				<li>Directing the photography and filming</li>				
			</ul>
			<p>I chose to shoot the subjects on a white infinity curve so I could quickly remove the background in post-production, and also colour it easily with lighting gels.</p>
			<p>
			After the shoot I worked with the photographer and specialist retouchers to prepare the shots for website and print usage. I also worked with the videographer to edit our footage and compose a video. I helped the client write a script for narration and supervised the recording by a voiceover artist.

			<h2>Post-launch</h2>
			<p>After switching over to the new design, I continued to monitor reports from the site analytics, form and ecommerce statistics, and user monitoring (through Clicktale).</p>
			<p>Changes that I made soon after launch included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Reformatted the online booking form so it was only on one page - reduced abandonment rate by 10%</li>
				<li>Added an extra text promotion area on the homepage which quickly became one of the most clicked links as it took users directly to special offers.</li>
				<li>Set up conversion funnels and ecommerce tracking in analytics to give a more detailed picture of user behaviour</li>
